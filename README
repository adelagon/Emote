Introduction
--------
A media player based on GTK+ and gstreamer that I started for learning purposes

Directory Structure :)
-------------------
data - misc. files (*.glade)
src  - source directory

Requirements
------------
    gstreamer-0.10
    libglade-2.0

Building
--------
There's no automake tools yet. For now, build the source with this command while you're
in the src directory:

$ gcc -Wall $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gstreamer-0.10,libglade-2.0) *.c -o ../emote
